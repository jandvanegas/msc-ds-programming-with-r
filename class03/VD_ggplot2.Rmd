class: center, middle

# Part 1: Introduction 

---


#  Location, Spread and Shape in univariate data

* In the first part we focus on descriptive measures, numerical and graphical, to
characterize and visualize the features of a particular univariate distribution. 
* The following three main factors are usually used to specify a paticular distribution:
  * Location
  * Spread
  * Shape

* Each of these control different characteristics of a distribution.

---

# R datasets for illustraions

* In order to simplify the usage of slides, the data we used for illustrations are R datasets.
* We give a short description  of each data in the relevant slides.
* More details can be found with <tt>help(dataset)</tt> or (for datasets of the first part) in

  * The singers data: [singers](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/lattice/html/singer.html).
  * The airquality data: [airquality](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/airquality.html).

# Part 2: <tt>ggplot2</tt>: a short introduction

`Focus: Layers` <br>

---

# The layers of a <tt>ggplot2</tt> figure 

* A key idea behind <tt>ggplot2</tt> is that it allows to easily building up a complex plot layer by layer. 
* Each layer adds an extra level of information to the plot.
* In that way we can build sophisticated plots tailored to the problem at hand. 
---


# The <tt>mtcars</tt> data 

* The data gives information about fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models).
```{r}
head(mtcars)
```

* For our example: <tt>mpg</tt>, <tt>hp</tt> and <tt>cyl</tt>.
---

# The <tt>mtcars</tt> data 


.pull-left[
* Bivariate data (miles/(US) per gallon, horsepower).
* Basic scatterplot in R: mgp Vs. hp.
* <tt>plot()</tt>.
* Our aim: fit a linear regression model for mpg with Horsepower as predictor.
]

.pull-right[

```{r}
plot(mtcars$hp,mtcars$mpg)
```
]

---


# Linear regression 

* A simple linear regression model in R.

```{r}
fit.lm<-lm(mtcars$mpg~mtcars$hp)
```

* Fitted model

```{r}
summary(fit.lm)
```

---


# First layer: basic plot 

.pull-left[
* Basic plot using <tt>ggplot2</tt>.
* Scaterplot and labels.
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
gg <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(hp, mpg)) +
        geom_point() +
        labs(x = "Horsepower",y= "Miles Per Gallon")
gg
```
]

---



# What is <tt>aes()</tt> ?

* <tt>aes()</tt>: generate aesthetic mappings that describe how variables in the data are mapped to visual properties (Aesthetics) of geoms.

* <tt>aes()</tt> is a quoting function. This means that its inputs are quoted to be evaluated in the context of the data.

* <tt>aes(hp, mpg)</tt>: use the vraiables <tt>mpg</tt> and <tt>hp</tt> in the plot.

* ggplot2 Cheat Sheet: [ggplot2](https://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/UG/SM/STAT3022/r/current/Misc/data-visualization-2.1.pdf).

---

# Second layer: add Cylinders information 

.pull-left[
* Add colors to the data points (by Cylinders number).
* <tt>aes(color=as.factor(cyl)), size=5</tt>.
as.factor converts cy1 to a factor variable, so it is represented as categorical and not number
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
gg <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(hp, mpg)) +
        geom_point(aes(color=as.factor(cyl)), size=5) +
        labs(x = "Horsepower",y= "Miles Per Gallon",color= "# of Cylinders")
gg
```
]

---

# What is <tt>geom</tt> ?

* A ggplot2 <tt>geom</tt> tells the plot how do we want to display the data in R. 
* For example, <tt>geom_bar()</tt>  makes a bar chart.
* <tt>geom_point(aes(color=as.factor(cyl)), size=5)</tt>: produce a scaterplot with points.
* <tt>aes(color=as.factor(cyl))</tt>: use different colors acording to the <tt>cyl</tt> levels.
* ggplot2 Cheat Sheet: [ggplot2](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf).

# Location

.pull-left[
* Location is the center of the distribution. 
* The figure presents distributions with different locations.
* Two normal densities with mean equal to 0 (the black line) and mean equal to 2 (the red line).

x<-seq(from=-5,to=5,length=1000)
dx1<-dnorm(x,0,1)
dx2<-dnorm(x,2,1)
plot(x,dx1,type="l")
lines(x,dx2,col=2)
```
]

---

# Location

.pull-left[
* Histograms for two $random$ $samples$ drawn from normal distribution with the same variance but different  mean. 
* Both histograms show that the data are symmetric around the sample mean but the histogram of $x_{2}$ is located to the right relative to the histogram of $x_{1}$. 
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
x1 <- rnorm(10000, 0, 1)
x2 <- rnorm(10000, 2, 1)
par(mfrow = c(2, 1))

hist(x2, col = 0, nclass = 50, xlim = c(-4, 6))
```
]

# Graphical displays for location
.pull-left[
* How can we visualize the distribution ?
* How can we visualize a shift in location ?
* Numerical summaries for location (look at the book): mean. median, trimmed mean...
]

.pull-right[

#  The singer dataset
* The singer datset (the R object <tt>singer</tt>) is a data frame giving the heights of singers in the New York Choral Society. 
* The variables are named <tt>height</tt> (inches) and <tt>voice.part</tt> which is the voice group of the singer

   * Alto.
   * Sporano.
   * Tenor.
   * Bass.
   
* Each voice group is subdivied into two groups, high voice and low voice (for example Bass1 and Bass2 and the lower and higher Bass voices, respectivly). 
* Main focus: the distribution of the singers' <tt>height</tt>.

---

#  The singer dataset

* The data:

```{r}
head(singer)
```

---

# Stripplot (<tt>lattice</tt>)

.pull-left[
* Stripplot:  plots the data of each voice group in a different strip. 
* <tt>voice.part~height</tt>.
* A clear main pattern in the data: 
  * It is easy to distinguish between women (Sopranos and Altos) and men (Tenors and Basses). 
  * Women are clearly shorter than men.
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
dotplot(singer$voice.part~singer$height, 
		aspect=1,
		xlab="Mean Height (inches)")
```
]

---

# Stripplot (<tt>ggplot2</tt>): first layer

.pull-left[
* An equivalent stripplot can be produced using the <tt>ggplot()</tt> package. 
* The function <tt>geom_jitter</tt>: observatios with the same values will be ploted side by side and will not overlap so sample size would be seen as well in the plot.  
]

.pull-right[
```{r}
ggplot(singer, 
       aes(voice.part,height)) + 
       geom_jitter(position = position_jitter(width = .05))
```
]

---

# Mean by voice group

* In order to get a better insight of other patterns, we can summarize the distribution of each group with the sample mean. 
* In R this can be done using the function <tt>tapply()</tt>. 
* To calculate mean of height by the voice group in the singer dataset we use

```{r}
attach(singer)
tapply(singer$height,singer$voice.part,mean)
```

---

# Mean by voice group

* The group means point on the pattern that was already detected: on average men are taller than women. 
* In addition, we can see that within each gender group, singers with lower voice are taller than singers with higher voice. 
* For example, the average of the two bass groups (71.38 and 70.71 for Bass 1 and Bass 2 respectively) are higher than the average in the tenor groups (69.90 and 68.90 for Tenor 1 and Tenor 2 respectively). 

---

# Mean by voice group

* Among women, the sopranos are shorter, on average, than the altos. 
* Within each voice group (all except the sopranos), the singers with lower voices (the second voice group Bass 2, Tenor 2 and Alto 2) are taller than the singers with the higher voices (the first group Bass 1, Tenor 1 and Alto 1). 
* For example the mean of the Bass 2 group (71.38) is higher than the mean of the Bass 1 group (70.71)

---


# Stripplot (<tt>ggplot2</tt>): second layer

.pull-left[
*  The Figure shows the same information as in slide 34 with the addtion of the mean for each voice group.
* <tt>stat_summary()</tt>.

```{r}
ggplot(singer, aes(voice.part,height)) +
geom_point() +
stat_summary(geom = "point", fun.y = "mean", colour = "red", size = 4)
```
]

---

# Boxplot (<tt>lattice</tt>)

.pull-left[
* Graphical display of the location of each distribution is the box plot.
* The location of each group is summarized by the median (the dot inside the box). 
* Other aspects of this plot will be discussed in later chapters). 
* Note that the function <tt>bwplot()</tt> is a part of the <tt>lattice</tt> package.

.pull-right[
```{r}
bwplot(as.factor(singer$voice.part)~ singer$height,

# Multiway histogram (<tt>lattice</tt>)

.pull-left[

* The multiway histogram presents the distributions of heights across the voice groups. 
* Note how the distribution of height is shiffted from left to right across the voice levels.
]

```{r}
histogram(~ height | voice.part,
		data=singer, layout = c(2, 4), 
		  aspect = 0.5,xlab = "height")

# Multiway histogram (<tt>ggplot2</tt>)

.pull-left[
* An equivalent multiway histogram can be produce with the <tt>ggplot2</tt> package.
* Addtional two layers in the basic plot:
  * The first layer spacifys the plot type <tt>histogram()</tt>.
  * The second layer indicates the factor for the plot partions.
  * The function <tt>facet_wrap(factor)</tt>.

# Spread

.pull-left[
* Two samples  were drawn from normal distribution with mean equal to 0 but with different variance. 
* The two distributions have the same shape, both histograms are symmetric around 0 as expected. 
* The spread in the histogram of $x_{2}$ is much higher than the spread in the histogram of $x_{1}$.

hist(x2, col = 0, nclass = 50, xlim = c(-4, 6), ylim = c(0, 1000))
```
]

---

# Main concepts
 * Up till now we summarized the distribution of the data with location estimators.
 * In this chapter we focus on the spread. 
 * We want to measure how close the data are to each other and how concentrate the data around the center of the distribution.
 * Numerical summaries for spread (see in the book):
 
    * The sample variance.
    * The fourth-spared.
    * The MAD as measures
  
 * Graphical displays:
 
   * boxplot.
   * violin plot.
   
---


# Boxplot: A graphical display for spread and location

.pull-left[
* Boxplot is a graphical display which shows the location, the spread and the shape of the distribution. 
* The location is summarized by the median, the spread is summarized by the fourth-spread which is simply the length of the box in the boxplot.
* Inside the box: $50\%$ of the data.

# Boxplot: A graphical display for spread and location

* The upper and lower adjacent values in the boxplot are given by

$$\mbox{Upper adjacent value} = \textit{Min}  \left \{ max(X),Q_{3}+1.5(Q_{3}-Q_{1}) \right \}$$

$$\mbox{Lower adjacent value} = \textit{max}  \left \{ min(X),Q_{1}-1.5(Q_{3}-Q_{1}) \right \}$$

* The upper and lower adjacent values are used to identify extrime values. 
* Observations higher than the upper adjacent value or smaller than the lower adjacent value are considered to be outliers.

# Example: the airqiality data

.pull-left[
* Daily air quality measurements in New York, May to September 1973.

# Part 6: Shape (normal probability plot)

`Focus: Normal distribution?` <br>

---


#  Normal probability plot

* A normal probability plot is a plot in which the quantile of the samples are plotted versus the corresponding quantiles of a standard normal distribution $N(0,1)$. 
* In this chapter we discuss the normal probability plot as a graphical tools to vizualise the shape of a distribution. 
* Using histograms and boxplots we are able to investigate the shape of the distribution focusing on the follwing issues:

  * How nearly symmetric the distribution of the data is.
  * Whether the distribution of the data is single-peaked, or whether it is multi-peaked.
  * Whether it is skewed.
  * How far we  from a Normal distribution ?
  
---


# Quantile of $N(\mu,\sigma^{2})$: Definition and a simple example

* A qq normal plot is a graphical disply to investigate how now nearly is the sample to a normal distribution. Let $q_{\mu,\sigma}(f)$ be a quantile of $N(\mu,\sigma^{2})$, it can be expressed as

$$q_{\mu,\sigma}(f)=\mu+\sigma q_{0,1}(f).$$

* For example, the $2.5 \% $ quantile of the standard normal distribution is -1.96. 

```{r}
qnorm(0.025,0,1)
```

* For $N(2,5^{2})$ we have 

$$q_{2,5}(2.5 \% )=2+ 5 \times - 1.96=-7.8$$


```{r}
qnorm(0.025,2,5)
```
